;;; Commentary:

;; Literate-elisp is an Emacs Lisp library to provide an easy way to use literate programming in Emacs Lisp.
;; It extends the Emacs load mechanism so Emacs can load Org files as Lisp source files directly.

;;; Code:

;; The code is automatically generated by function `literate-elisp-tangle' from file `literate-elisp.org'.
;; It is not designed to be readable by a human.
;; It is generated to load by Emacs directly without depending on `literate-elisp'.
;; you should read file `literate-elisp.org' to find out the usage and implementation detail of this source file.
